# Pure Beauty Low-Fidelity Prototyping

## Digital Humanities 110 - Lowfi by Peterson Le
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of creating a low fidelity prototype is to have a general understanding of my application's content and features. It allows me to visualize the layout, while also providing me materials to test on users to establish whether the organization of information is intuitive and logical.
 
### Users
The users that I have identified are middle-aged adults and senior citizens; have skin concerns (e.g., aging, acne) or skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis); lower middle- and low-income communities. The latter is due to the inaccessibility in healthcare currently, so I would like this application to push for alternatives to seeking medical professional (e.g., product recommendations and home remedies) if that is beyond a user's means.

### Features and Tasks
The features and tasks that this low-fidelity prototype enables are a community feature and product recommendation/discovery page with an emphasis on its organization of information that would address the pain points of other applications (e.g., Facebook, Cleo, TroveSkin). The features seeks to address overwhelming layouts (too many features on one page and excessive scrolling to find information) by minimizing distractions on screen, very surface level connections by adding instant messaging systems, and the lack of information on product discovery pages to would result in the need for third party applications.

## Wireframe and Wireflow

## Notes on Wireflow Test
### Task01: Toggle between discussion posts and instant messaging
I had the users tell me what they believe the name and icons used for "Discussion" and "Instant Message" would show when they click it. I expected "Instant Message" to have more issues, however, the user was unable to accurately predict what the discussion would be. So instead, I may change the title to "Post." The logo most likely influenced how well users performed in predicting "Instant Message" so a change in icon may also be needed.

### Task02: Filter discussion posts by tags
The user found the placement of the filter button and icon to be unintuitive, especially because the sort feature is written as "Popular | Most Recent" while the filter feature is a basic icon used in many events (e.g., settings). However, after establishing the button, filtering became easy. Thus, I must change the way I chose to depict the filter button/icon - most likely changing it to a button with the word "Filter."

### Task03: View product reviews
The user had no issue with this task as it is very similar to other applications they have used before. However, it may resemble more of those apps if I allow the user to click on the star ratings which would then navigate to the reviews instead of having a large button at the bottom. Having multiple ways to navigate throughout the site may also be good for the users as it provides the with more flexibility.

## Summary
I really enjoyed the process of creating a low-fidelity prototype. Looking back, I may have put too much detail in my wireflow and could have potentially added more detail to my initial wireframes. Nonetheless the wireframining gave me a strong foundation to make the wireflow to begin with. If I had more time, I would have liked to test out what filters do users think they need for discussion posts beyond Popular, Most Recent, and Tags. I would also need to create low fidelity prototypings for the filter option on the product discovery page, as well as how channels would be for instant messaging. I also wonder if private messaging would be needed for this application or if that may be going in the wrong direction as I still want the main focus to be about developing a healthy skin care regime for skin conditions. There is a lot to think about for the next projects but I am excited to transfer over the designs to Figma for a more interactive prototype.
