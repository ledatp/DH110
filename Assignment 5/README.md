# Pure Beauty Low-Fidelity Prototyping

## Digital Humanities 110 - Lowfi by Peterson Le
## Overview
**Purpose** <br/>
The purpose of creating a low fidelity prototype is to have a general understanding of my application's content and features. It allows me to visualize the layout, while also providing me materials to test on users to establish whether the organization of information is intuitive and logical.
 
**Users** <br/>
The users that I have identified are middle-aged adults and senior citizens; have skin concerns (e.g., aging, acne) or skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis); lower middle- and low-income communities. The latter is due to the inaccessibility in healthcare currently, so I would like this application to push for alternatives to seeking medical professional (e.g., product recommendations and home remedies) if that is beyond a user's means.

**Features and Tasks** <br/>
The features and tasks that this low-fidelity prototype enables are a community feature and product recommendation/discovery page with an emphasis on its organization of information that would address the pain points of other applications (e.g., Facebook, Cleo, TroveSkin). The features seeks to address overwhelming layouts (too many features on one page and excessive scrolling to find information) by minimizing distractions on screen, very surface level connections by adding instant messaging systems, and the lack of information on product discovery pages to would result in the need for third party applications.
