# Skin: Your Personal Skincare Coach
## Peterson Le

### Introduction
Skin is a personalized skincare application that guides users to improve their skin disorders by providing convenient access to skincare products, establishing a community based on the needs of the user, and keep skin diaries to effectively monitor and analyze ones' skin journey over time in response to their lifestyle. Throughout my youth and into adulthood, I have battled with skin conditions that left me insecure and anxious; thus, this application resembles one that I wish I knew about earlier. 

### Design Statement
With the pandemic becoming a major stressor, it is imperative that we keep our mind and body at ease -- hence, I introduced Skin to help provide accessible and convenient content to help users create an optimal skincare routine and connect them with others who may face similar hardships in their skincare journey. Although I believe my application has the potential to reach and please a large demographic, I attempted to centeralize my designs around senior citizens. By doing so, I can ensure that the final product is completely user friendly, accessible, and  resemble applications that they tend to populate. My goal is to help users nourish and protect their skin as it is never too late to begin your personal skincare journey.
