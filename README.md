# Skin: Your Personal Skincare Coach
## Peterson Le

### Introduction
Skin is a personalized skincare application that guides users to improve their skin disorders by providing convenient access to skincare products, establishing a community based on the needs of the user, and keep skin diaries to effectively monitor and analyze ones' skin journey over time in response to their lifestyle. Throughout my youth and into adulthood, I have battled with skin conditions that left me insecure and anxious; thus, this application resembles one that I wish I knew about earlier. 

### Design Statement
With the pandemic becoming a major stressor, it is imperative that we keep our mind and body at ease -- hence, I introduced Skin to help provide accessible and convenient content to help users create an optimal skincare routine and connect them with others who may face similar hardships in their skincare journey. Although I believe my application has the potential to reach and please a large demographic, I attempted to centeralize my designs around senior citizens. By doing so, I can ensure that the final product is completely user friendly, accessible, and  resemble applications that they tend to populate. My goal is to help users nourish and protect their skin as it is never too late to begin your personal skincare journey.

### Competitor Analysis and Heuristics Evaluation
I conducted a heuristics evaluation based on [Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) on TroveSkin and Cloe -- two skincare apps with similar functions that I wanted to implement into my own designs. I learned about what worked well and what improvements could be made, essentially establishing a severity rating for usability problems. I noticed that Cloe had many problems with UI and backend development, so some functions were dificult to use. However, I appreciated its minimalism and "easy to use" appearance. TroveSkin, on the other hand, had less severe usability issues but had more confusing components and descriptions for its site's function. Nonetheless, I used both as my starting point, but broadened what the application was used for. Instead of a skincare application for things like acne and acne, I wanted to create an application for all skin disorders. [...read more](https://github.com/ledatp/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%201)

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
After conducting a heuristics evaluation on Cloe, I found many issues that I wanted to address and see if it was a user error or an error with the user experience design. I wanted to see if other users come into contact with these issues, and whether these issues disrupts the flow of the user. Therefore, I conducted a usability test to discover how the users would navigate throughout the site in spite of these issues. The test will try to capture the effectiveness and efficiency by having the user perform key tasks and recording their interactions with the site. In addition, this test will test for user satisfaction by conducting a survery about their experience using the site. Task01 and Task02 will test how effective is the entry log and the ability to only input one diary per day (morning skincare routine and night skincare routine will be shown in the same box). Task03 will test the functionality of the search feature, or the lack thereof, and the methods users use to search for items when the search feature is down. Lastly, a survey at the end that ask questions about the difficulty of the site, their satifactions, and a simple desirability test will be ensued. I was surprised to find that the participant did not run into many usability problems that i had found initially because the site resembles applications that they use to track their period cycle or calories.
