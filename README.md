# Prevent Aging by Curating Optimal Skincare Regime

## Digital Humanities 110 - Heuristics Evaluation by Peterson Le
### Motivation
Skincare is something I have recently indulged in during college, and have been doing more research on in quarantine to learn how to protect my skin in changing environments. I thought this would be an interesting topic for our UX design topic because skincare is relevant for all ages as we must constantly reevaluate the products we use to address our problem areas -- acne-prone skin, wrinkles and aging, etc. Creating an app that recommends skincare products, analyzes current skin needs and progress, and build an online community to learn about skincare (e.g., harmful ingredients) would help us take care of our body through the curation of an optimal skincare routine. I will be addressing two skincare applications (Cleo and TroveSkin) with similar goals, yet have much room for improvements. <br/>

#### Application 1: Cleo
Cloe is a personal skincare diary where you can log the products that you are using and record your skin’s progress. You can also leave reviews on the products that you have tried, while also containing a pseudo-social media where you can post your review and rating of products, leave likes, and write comments. <br/>

#### Application 2: TroveSkin
TroveSkin is a skincare application that allows users to take quizzes to determine their skin type and recommend products based on the results. This app’s feature includes keeping track of your daily habits, obtaining skin analyses, and access to articles related to skin, beauty, and health. <br/>

### Heuristics Evaluation Severity Ratings
**1**: Site performed average for this heuristic and does not need to be reevaluated/altered for better usability.<br/>
**2**: Site performed slightly below average for this heuristic and has the potential to be altered for better usability.<br/>
**3**: Site performed below average for this heuristic and could use major immediate reevaluation for better usability.<br/>

## Cleo Heuristics Evaluation Ratings
### Visibility of System Status
***Severity Rating: 3*** When using the search feature on the main page and the camera feature (separate from the one on the diary entry page), it takes you to a blank screen without any signifiers that it is loading. Here, I searched “Lymecycline” in the search bar, an item I saw already posted, and was met with a purely blank screen. Similarly, I went to take a photo to update my logs and was unable to access the camera, despite allowing the app access to my camera.<br/>

*Recommendation:* Fix the backend of the application to make these functions usable. <br/>
### Match Between Systems and Real World
***Severity Rating: 2*** The icons used to separate the pages are definitely intuitive (i.e., using a calendar for the diary logs, camera icon to access camera, and graph to access analytics); however, after adding entries and posting reviews on the app, the analytics do not update. Therefore, I am left wondering whether there is more to the app that I am unaware of or if the app is not optimized correctly to perform this task. <br/>

**Update:** After a couple of hours, the analytics page updated and now illustrates that I have one entry and one post. This is a concern with the visibility of system status as Cleo does not attempt to reassure nor communicate to users that the analytics would take a while to update. <br/>

***Severity Rating: 3*** Users are able to set notification frequencies in the settings; however, there are two blank buttons with no description about what the buttons do. Thus, users must guess whether the top button is for high frequency or low frequency. In addition, regardless of buttons, you can only select one time to receive notifications. If a user would like a reminder to be reminded to wash their face in the morning and night, then it is impossible to do so using Cleo. <br/>

### User Control and Freedom
***Severity Rating: 1*** After entering an entry, users are capable of editing and deleting the entry. In addition, they can delete the photos they have taken for that day. This gives users the freedom to correct any mistakes or discard unwanted entries on their daily logs. Similarly, they can delete posts, but I do not believe they have editing access to it once it is posted. <br/>

### Consistency and Standard
***Severity Rating: 2*** As aforementioned, the app’s homepage consists of a pseudo-social media that mimics apps like Instagram. Therefore, those familiar with instagram would have an easy time using the app to post reviews and scroll. However, it is unclear if there is a proper algorithm to the app where it shows you products catered to your skin type and concern. Without a proper search feature, filter function, explore page, or the ability to visit reviewer’s profiles it is difficult to see any use to the reviews posted. <br/>

### Error Prevention
***Severity Rating: 1*** When editing a diary entry, I assumed all edits were automatically saved and pressing the back button would update the entry. However, when pressing the back button, an error message occurs asking if the user would like to discard all changes made to the entry. <br/>

### Recogniton Rather than Recall 
***Severity Rating: 3*** When you like or interact with a review about a skincare product, there is no space to access all of your liked contents. Therefore, users must recall what products they were interested in through scrolling through the home page. This is very time consuming and could potentially disrupt the flow of the user. <br/>

### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
***Severity Rating: 2*** There are multiple ways to add photos on the app to keep track of your skincare process —  one through the diary entry and one through the general camera feature. Because the diary entries are mainly for end of the day inputs (due to users only being allowed one entry per day), having two options is great for when you are having breakouts or skin complications throughout the day (or have shown great improvements) and would like to take update picture both in the day and at night for the entries. However, the general camera feature does not work as aforementioned or the waiting time is too long without any signifiers that it is loading. <br/>

### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
***Severity Rating: 1*** Cleo has a very minimalistic design with key features needed to keep track of your skin and skincare regime. Because of this, it is very easy to use if we disregard the malfunctions of some of the features. There could have been different design choices that may make the app look better; however, those are more personal decisions that do not interfere with the user interface. <br/>

### Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
***Severity Rating: 1*** There are no error messages on the application; however, I was never in the position to need one. Because they allow users to edit much of the content that they post, it makes recovering from “errors” less taxing. <br/>

### Help and Documentation
***Severity Rating: 2*** There is no help (e.g., FAQ page) or any documentation that should assist users. I suspect Cleo believes their site to be highly intuitive; however, a simple onboarding process for new users would help users adjust to the new site. <br/>
