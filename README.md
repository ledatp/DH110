# Prevent Aging by Curating Optimal Skincare Regime

## Digital Humanities 110 - Heuristics Evaluation by Peterson Le
### Motivation
Skincare is something I have recently indulged in during college, and have been doing more research on in quarantine to learn how to protect my skin in changing environments. I thought this would be an interesting topic for our UX design topic because skincare is relevant for all ages as we must constantly reevaluate the products we use to address our problem areas -- acne-prone skin, wrinkles and aging, etc. Creating an app that recommends skincare products, analyzes current skin needs and progress, and build an online community to learn about skincare (e.g., harmful ingredients) would help us take care of our body through the curation of an optimal skincare routine. I will be addressing two skincare applications (Cleo and TroveSkin) with similar goals, yet have much room for improvements. <br/>

#### Application 1: Cleo
Cloe is a personal skincare diary where you can log the products that you are using and record your skin’s progress. You can also leave reviews on the products that you have tried, while also containing a pseudo-social media where you can post your review and rating of products, leave likes, and write comments. <br/>

#### Application 2: TroveSkin
TroveSkin is a skincare application that allows users to take quizzes to determine their skin type and recommend products based on the results. This app’s feature includes keeping track of your daily habits, obtaining skin analyses, and access to articles related to skin, beauty, and health. <br/>

### Heuristics Evaluation Severity Ratings
**1**: Site performed average for this heuristic and does not need to be reevaluated/altered for better usability.<br/>
**2**: Site performed slightly below average for this heuristic and has the potential to be altered for better usability.<br/>
**3**: Site performed below average for this heuristic and could use major immediate reevaluation for better usability.<br/>
