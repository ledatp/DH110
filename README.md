# Skin: Your Personal Skincare Coach
## Peterson Le

### Introduction
Skin is a personalized skincare application that guides users to improve their skin disorders by providing convenient access to skincare products, establishing a community based on the needs of the user, and keep skin diaries to effectively monitor and analyze ones' skin journey over time in response to their lifestyle. Throughout my youth and into adulthood, I have battled with skin conditions that left me insecure and anxious; thus, this application resembles one that I wish I knew about earlier. 

### Design Statement
With the pandemic becoming a major stressor, it is imperative that we keep our mind and body at ease -- hence, I introduced Skin to help provide accessible and convenient content to help users create an optimal skincare routine and connect them with others who may face similar hardships in their skincare journey. Although I believe my application has the potential to reach and please a large demographic, I attempted to centeralize my designs around senior citizens. By doing so, I can ensure that the final product is completely user friendly, accessible, and  resemble applications that they tend to populate. My goal is to help users nourish and protect their skin as it is never too late to begin your personal skincare journey.

### Competitor Analysis and Heuristics Evaluation
I conducted a heuristics evaluation based on [Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) on TroveSkin and Cloe -- two skincare apps with similar functions that I wanted to implement into my own designs. I learned about what worked well and what improvements could be made, essentially establishing a severity rating for usability problems. I noticed that Cloe had many problems with UI and backend development, so some functions were dificult to use. However, I appreciated its minimalism and "easy to use" appearance. TroveSkin, on the other hand, had less severe usability issues but had more confusing components and descriptions for its site's function. Nonetheless, I used both as my starting point, but broadened what the application was used for. Instead of a skincare application for things like acne and acne, I wanted to create an application for all skin disorders. [...read more](https://github.com/ledatp/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%201)

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
After conducting a heuristics evaluation on Cloe, I found many issues that I wanted to address and see if it was a user error or an error with the user experience design. I wanted to see if other users come into contact with these issues, and whether these issues disrupts the flow of the user. Therefore, I conducted a usability test to discover how the users would navigate throughout the site in spite of these issues. The test will try to capture the effectiveness and efficiency by having the user perform key tasks and recording their interactions with the site. In addition, this test will test for user satisfaction by conducting a survery about their experience using the site. Task01 and Task02 will test how effective is the entry log and the ability to only input one diary per day (morning skincare routine and night skincare routine will be shown in the same box). Task03 will test the functionality of the search feature, or the lack thereof, and the methods users use to search for items when the search feature is down. Lastly, a survey at the end that ask questions about the difficulty of the site, their satifactions, and a simple desirability test will be ensued. I was surprised to find that the participant did not run into many usability problems that i had found initially because the site resembles applications that they use to track their period cycle or calories.

### User Research: Contextual Inquiry
After evaluating usability problems Cloe and Troveskin, I wanted to know what other applications do users use to learn more about their skin type, find skincare products, and find a community centered around this topic. In addition, it was imperative that I expand my questions to encompass participants with harsher skin disorders (psoriasis and eosinophilic pustular folliculitis), so I created [two inquiry guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZS_kkrQUv9Zcs6D_bZQKt_t7kS8-30eHeYnyEAJz9A/edit?usp=sharing) designed for low-risk skin disorders and high-risk skin disorders. I conducted a contextual inquiry to observes the different mediums that users use in which I can emulate their functions into my designs. The main site that were used for the tasks aforementioned was Tiktok for product discovery, YouTube and Amazon for product review, and Facebook for community building. After this meeting I delved deeper into these four websites to figure out how their designs promoted discoverability, learnability, and understanding.

### UX Storytelling
The users that I have identified are middle-aged adults and senior citizens; have skin concerns (e.g., aging, acne) or skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis); lower middle- and low-income communities. The latter is due to the inaccessibility in healthcare currently, so I would like this application to push for alternatives to seeking medical professional (e.g., product recommendations and home remedies) if that is beyond a user's means. The purpose of UX storytelling is to ensure that the designers always have the users in mind. By giving face, personality, and descriptions to specific users, designers will better understand their needs and accommodate them accordingly. In essence, putting ourselves in our userâ€™s shoes, taking upon their perspective and bringing them along to better understand our audience base, the pain points of our project, and the appropriate action for betterment. Here, I created two personas and journey maps with various needs and concerns, as well as their own specified scenarios.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
The features and tasks that this low-fidelity prototype enables are a community feature and product recommendation/discovery page with an emphasis on its organization of information that would address the pain points of other applications (e.g., Facebook, Cleo, TroveSkin). The features seeks to address overwhelming layouts (too many features on one page and excessive scrolling to find information) by minimizing distractions on screen, very surface level connections by adding instant messaging systems, and the lack of information on product discovery pages to would result in the need for third party applications.

### High-Fidelity Prototype
After bypassing the low-fidelity prototyping stage, I began finalizing designs and adding interactions. [... read more](https://github.com/ledatp/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%206)

### Pitch Video

### Conclusion
Overall, this process was incredibly eye-opening as it gave me a glimpse of what it is like to be a UX designer. If I had more time, there are definitely more functionalities I would like to include in my design, as well as conduct more iterations and user interviews to ensure that everything is intuitive. However, I am proud that I was able to build a prototype from scratch. This experience as a whole was very well-rounded, giving me insight on the research and UI design aspects of UX. I would have loved to speak to backend developers and engineers about the knowledge they've gained in this field as well as any "red flag" designs that are too difficult to implement beyond our prototypes.

This course made me realize that I would like to continue UX designs in which I will attempt smaller passion projects that redesigns existing applications rather than attempting to pitch a new one with additive features from other applications. I would also choose a different demographic to center my designs around, as it was incredibly difficult to access senior citizens for this project (especially when they need to have some form of technological expertise to do the interviews remotely). Lastly, I would love to work in pairs or groups as I know UX design requires much cooperation and communications, as well as allowed us to perform reiterations more efficiently. As I seek out more UX design experience, I will definitely use the skills I learned in this course to better support my team in our next design projects.
