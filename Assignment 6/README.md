# User Interface (UI) and Interactive Prototype
## Digital Humanities 110 - Peterson Le

## Part 1: UI Design
### Purpose
The purpose of this high fidelity is to test out the aesthetic that I want for my application. It uses the low fidelity prototype from the previous process and tranforms it into something more visually appealing and closer to the brand I wish for my application. With this, I get to test whether the icons, colors, and fonts are appropriate for a skincare application while also determining if the placements of these features are the most optimal and intuitive for discoverability, understanding, and functionality. I have used the software, Figma, to craft the prototype, and will continue using it to include interactions.

### Screen Designs
#### Design Variation

The three screens illustrates different variations for the application (dark mode, light mode, and hue variant). For the rest of the designs, I used dark mode because I believe the dark background is more visually appealing and allows for more minimal designs. The hue variant screen utilized colors that I liked; however, I fear that I will eventually run into some accessibility complications if I continued to use it.

#### Representative Design Screens

The six screens represents the type of application I wish to make, along with a few of the features I would like to include (log in, sign up, skin type quiz and results, home page for site navigation, and community page to post about skin journeys). I worked on these aspects using Figma, as aforementioned, and would still like to include product recommendation for the interactive prototype. However, I believe it would be a mixture of the home page and community page (e.g., slide and scroll features), so it made more sense to work on those first. 

### Color Contrast Check
#### Primary Text

This color contrast is for the general application, it mainly utilize a dark brown background and tan text; however, some instances uses tan background and dark brown text. Both of these scenarios pass the color contrast check.

#### Button Test

All buttons will be displayed as green text or as a green oval-shaped button. With the oval-shaped button, it will be accompanied by the dark brown text. In that instance, it passes the color contrast check.

### Design Systems

Because my application is about skin care and minimal, I thought to use different variants of brown to imitate bare skin. I initially played with many different variations of browns, but it was difficult to get it to pass the color contrast check. Therefore, I ended up using a very dark brown paired with a light sand/tan color. I entered those colors into an application that helped me find another color to act as a button that matches the theme. Thus, I found that the sage green color worked well with the shades of browns. As for the fonts, I tend to use Jost and Inter fonts because they are some of the most standard fonts according to various online sources whereas the sizes for the fonts were purely based on how I felt it fit on the iphone screens. Lastly, for the material icons, I used downloaded a Figma plugin with a plethora of icons, and used ones similar to other applications like Facebook and Troveskin.

### Impressions Test
For the impression test, I was unable to attend half of the class. So instead, I sent the figma link to the participant and had a phone interview where they explained which screen they are looking at, what affordances the screen enables, and general impressions about the color, typography, icons, and flow. If I had more time today, I would have liked to have set up a full recorded zoom session and activty protocol; however, this was all I can do for the time constraint. The main findings are:
* "I love the colors and the logo! It is very straight to the point." My design choices was to mimic skin tones paired with a very minimalist design (hence, using lowercase and bolds give off that feel). I'm glad it came across well.
* Participant stated that there might be missing flow between the sign up page and the homepage as there is no way to identify what skin condition the user have and how the system would know. I agree with this sentiment and will incorporate more screens to make the site complete.
* Participant was able to accurately predict the affordances of the screens, and believe that the icons are intruitive for the navigation bar.
* Add a back button for the quiz

## Part 2: Interactive Prototype
### Purpose
After receiving feedback on the UI aspects of my design and making final edits to its appearance, I was ready to start creating screens and interactions between them. The main task that are supported with this prototype is the ability to take a skincare quiz to determine skin type, navigate and post to the community pages, find products on the discovery page, and enter a skin diary log for morning routines. There a few minor interactions inbetween as well to make the application feel a little more alive. I then moderated a cognitive walkthrough and survey to see if my participants would have any issue completing the tasks, while the survey was used to get feedback after allowing the participant to play with the site on their own.

### Wireflow

### Cognitive Walkthrough, Feedback, and Reflection
For the cognitive walkthrough interview, I gave my participant six tasks to complete and examined how they interacted with the application to spot area of improvement. After that I allowed the participant to play around with the site and sent them a google survey with questions about difficulties and possible feedback for the pages that they have interacted with.

The cognitive walkthrough went suprisingly well with little to no difficulties in completing the tasks provided. The main issue that I saw was that the participant found it difficult to spot the "Post" button on the community page. Therefore, I may change the text to a button instead to make it more visible. In addition, I believe adding more icons alongside button is something I should add. A separate participant said that I should add an uploud icon on the "open camera roll" button on the "Post" page, but it seems like icon is need more throughout my application nearside other buttons as well.

I did not screen capture the before designs of my application before making buttons and interactions more noticeable as well as adding icon, but the cognitive walkthrough video should act as a "previous" design (as well as the UI design screen captures), while the link to the interactive prototype should act as my current design. An example of what I change are adding rectangles behind the filter and post button and adding icons to accompany it, as well as icons to the open camera roll button.

Overall, the process of creating a completed high-fidelity prototype was hectic, especially given a week to do so. If I had more time, I would definitely add more interactions. But since I am new to Figma still, the process is very taxing. I believe if I had started with components first and then focused on creating screens then it would be a lot easier. All in all, I am proud of the work I was able to accomplish and how much I was able to learn about UX design and the research process within this 8 week project.
