# Contextual Inquiry: Users in Context
## Digital Humanities 110 - Peterson Le

## Main Goal of this Study
1. Determine how much users know about their specific skin type
2. Learn how users find information about skin care products that work best for their skin type
3. Learn how can we make developing a skin care routine easier for our user

## Main Design Challenges
**What is the main activity that your product would support the users in accomplishing?**<br/>
* This project would allow users to learn more about their skin type, skin concerns, and help them establish a healthy skin care routine that caters to them. This application    should have a community feature so others can share their experience with products and remedies they found to combat their skin concerns. 

**What is the basic need involved for this activity?**<br/>
* The basic need that this application would hopefully fulfill is security. I would like users to be able to choose their skin concerns and/or skin disorders and learn ways to prevent it using products, home remedies, or medication depending on the lifestyle of the specific user.

**What are the traditional and current solutions to satisfy the needs?**<br/>
* For issues concerning skin disorders and conditions, those typically would use websites to assist with diagnoses and a dermatologist for the recommendation of products and medication. However, as this traditional method can be inaccessible and costly, building an online community platform to address this may be more beneficial.
* Traditional ways to keep track of skin is using your phone camera and creating a folder with updates. However, there is much information that is lost when this is the only method of keeping diaries of one’s skin care journey (e.g., products used, reactions, initial perception of improvements).

**What is the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with digital technology?**
* Receiving medical treatment and visiting a dermatologist can be costly, especially if certain medications and previous treatment have not worked - digital technology can give recommendations of products that are within the means of the users. For instance, if a user is uncomfortable with medication, they can look for alternative remedies and a community with similar practices to share their experiences. In my personal experience with dermatologists, they tend to recommend products that are very expensive, so I had to do my own research for dupes. This project would help solve this pain point.
* The elderly do not have immediate knowledge of technology to do their own research using Google and the site it holds, Youtube, or Tiktok (sites that my participant in the first study used for skincare advice). Therefore, making an accessible app that holds the capability to do much of the research for the user can assist older users find products to address their skin concerns.

## Target Users
**What are the characteristics of the users?**
* Demographics: Middle aged adults to senior citizens; have skin concerns (e.g., aging) or skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis); lower middle- and low-income communities.
* Preference: Want to improve their skin’s condition, find communities with similar concerns, and open to trying new skincare methods.
* Expertise: Little to medium experience with technology; new to skincare and want to learn more about the benefits of starting a routine.

**Where would the users do that activity?**
* I have made slight alterations to my initial project statement; thus, there will be a mixture of applications that could be used to do this activity. First is TroveSkin, a skincare tracker that provides product recommendation and online community for common skincare concerns (e.g., acne, hyperpigmentations, etc). However, I would like there to not be a focus on skin conditions as well; thus, apps like MayoClinic that is used to help users diagnose the problems they are having would be a great addition to my project. Unfortunately, MayoClinic provides very surface level recommendations for treatments, so this project should give more in depth analysis of skin conditions.
* **Note:** *Users must be notified that this is a user driven application, and the effectiveness of products on the community section are situational to the individual. However, if the app were to be developed, a certified medical professional should be present throughout the stages of development.*

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
* In order to complete these activities in a traditional sense, users would go see dermatologists, track their own skin journey (phone camera), and use multiple media to research products (plethora of Google links, Youtube) and find their own communities (Reddit, Facebook). However, applications such as TroveSkin and MayoClinic have created a place to do many of those activities. With this upcoming application, users should be able build an online community with similar concerns, receive recommendations to products that are advertised to their demographic, get general information about their health concerns, and keep a diary log of their skin conditions.

## Research Methods
I wanted to gain insight on what applications a user uses to get more information about skincare products and skin condition remedies. So, I chose a participant with underlying health conditions who also had interests in skin care. I conducted a contextual inquiry which consisted of asking the user to perform tasks and answering questions about their experience.

**Background Questions** 
* I asked the user questions regarding how they typically take diaries of their skin's progress and how often they do it. I also asked questions regarding their current skin type, skin concern, and skin condition. Although the user does not fully fit within my targeted audience (due to age), they had many qualities that I am looking for in users.

**Observation Tasks**
* I asked the users general questions regarding what applications they use to find reviews and product recommendations and allowed them to show me examples using products that they were already comfortable with. I then asked them to walk me through how they would search for specific attributes for products and whether that information felt readily available to them.

**Follow Ups**
* I wanted to know more about how to establish trust with brands or how users determine whether a product can be deemed trustworthy. Therefore, I asked about what makes them make certain decisions to buy products (e.g., price, branding, customer reviews, healthcare profession reviews). I also asked questions regarding site satisfaction in terms of the ease of process as well as determining what information on the site bare little importance to them.

## Interview Insight
**User was unsatisfied with modern way of keeping progress of skin's journey** <br/>
* The user stated that initially they used the camera to take photo of their skin daily; however, it became really complicated over time. When photos are inside of a phone's album, they found it difficult to keep track of dates and to compare between photos to ensure that the skin is reacting well to products. As a result, they only track their skin when they have flare ups. A lot of information can be missed if one does not track what happened prior to the flare up and what helped remedy the flare up afterwards. Thus, by making sure the application can solve some of the challenges the user face with skin diaries, we can ensure that the user make the right choices to perfecting their skin.

**User use manner different websites and applications to get product recommendations** <br/>
* During the interview, the user showed how they use Youtube, TikTok, Mayoclinic, WebMD, built-in iPhone features, and Google with its abundance of links to more websites to get skin products recommendation and reviews. This requires a lot of knowledge and experience with technology as users must navigate through the entire web to help their skin. Having a high functioning and all inclusive application would take away some of the cognitive load of doing the research yourself.

**User look for key words when finding reviews**<br/>
* The user used Amazon and Youtube for reviews on a product. With this they have to search for certain key words such as "light weight" and "hydrating," sometimes having to scroll through many reviews or watch lengthy videos. Combining the way these sites organize their information, in addition to allowing users to search for key words would be great for my project. In addition, the user preferred photograph reviews over written reviews, which would give insightt on the heirachy of information that should be presented.

**Difference between trustworthiness criteria for skincare products and skin condition products**<br/>
* The user stated that price was not a big factor in the trustworthiness of a product, but instead rely more heavily on customer reviews and star ratings. This reaffirmed the importance of a community feature on the upcoming product. This way, there can be reviews as well as conversations about a product, in contrast to most review sites only allowing upvotes. One difference that I saw between skincare products and skin condition products is that the user did not care if skincare products had any endorsements from a healthcare professional, but preferred if skin condition products had some, even if it is over the counter medications. 

## Reflection
There were a few internet connection issues during my interview, which resulted in me disconnecting from the Zoom meeting; however, I was still able to get through all of the tasks and questions. The interview itself though went well, I learned a lot about how users navigate throughout the web, which I feel would be less accessible for senior citizens. I also learned about what makes a skincare product more trustworthy in the eyes of the users, which differed slightly between skincare products and skin treatment products. As I develop my application, I will keep that in mind when establishing the hierarchy of information that will displayed for skin product reviews and descriptions. 

I think the most difficult part about Contextual Inquiries is finding key insights and connecting what the users say to the pain points that I have previously established from my heuristics evaluation. For future references, I hope for my Contextual Inquiries to be semi-structured (as opposed to structured) because the flow of my questions was very rigid given how my participants chose to respond. By having a less structured interview, I will potentially open doors to get deeper insight into the though process of the users.
