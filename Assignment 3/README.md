# Contextual Inquiry: Users in Context
## Digital Humanities 110 - Peterson Le

## Main Goal of this Study
1. Determine how much users know about their specific skin type
2. Learn how users find information about skin care products that work best for their skin type
3. Learn how can we make developing a skin care routine easier for our user

## Main Design Challenges
**What is the main activity that your product would support the users in accomplishing?**<br/>
* This project would allow users to learn more about their skin type, skin concerns, and help them establish a healthy skin care routine that caters to them. This application    should have a community feature so others can share their experience with products and remedies they found to combat their skin concerns. 

**What is the basic need involved for this activity?**<br/>
* The basic need that this application would hopefully fulfill is security. I would like users to be able to choose their skin concerns and/or skin disorders and learn ways to prevent it using products, home remedies, or medication depending on the lifestyle of the specific user.

**What are the traditional and current solutions to satisfy the needs?**<br/>
* For issues concerning skin disorders and conditions, those typically would use websites to assist with diagnoses and a dermatologist for the recommendation of products and medication. However, as this traditional method can be inaccessible and costly, building an online community platform to address this may be more beneficial.
* Traditional ways to keep track of skin is using your phone camera and creating a folder with updates. However, there is much information that is lost when this is the only method of keeping diaries of one’s skin care journey (e.g., products used, reactions, initial perception of improvements).

**What is the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with digital technology?**
* Receiving medical treatment and visiting a dermatologist can be costly, especially if certain medications and previous treatment have not worked - digital technology can give recommendations of products that are within the means of the users. For instance, if a user is uncomfortable with medication, they can look for alternative remedies and a community with similar practices to share their experiences. In my personal experience with dermatologists, they tend to recommend products that are very expensive, so I had to do my own research for dupes. This project would help solve this pain point.
* The elderly do not have immediate knowledge of technology to do their own research using Google and the site it holds, Youtube, or Tiktok (sites that my participant in the first study used for skincare advice). Therefore, making an accessible app that holds the capability to do much of the research for the user can assist older users find products to address their skin concerns.

## Target Users
**What are the characteristics of the users?**
* Demographics: Middle aged adults to senior citizens; have skin concerns (e.g., aging) or skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis); lower middle- and low-income communities.
* Preference: Want to improve their skin’s condition, find communities with similar concerns, and open to trying new skincare methods.
* Expertise: Little to medium experience with technology; new to skincare and want to learn more about the benefits of starting a routine.

**Where would the users do that activity?**
* I have made slight alterations to my initial project statement; thus, there will be a mixture of applications that could be used to do this activity. First is TroveSkin, a skincare tracker that provides product recommendation and online community for common skincare concerns (e.g., acne, hyperpigmentations, etc). However, I would like there to not be a focus on skin conditions as well; thus, apps like MayoClinic that is used to help users diagnose the problems they are having would be a great addition to my project. Unfortunately, MayoClinic provides very surface level recommendations for treatments, so this project should give more in depth analysis of skin conditions.
* **Note:** *Users must be notified that this is a user driven application, and the effectiveness of products on the community section are situational to the individual. However, if the app were to be developed, a certified medical professional should be present throughout the stages of development.*

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
* In order to complete these activities in a traditional sense, users would go see dermatologists, track their own skin journey (phone camera), and use multiple media to research products (plethora of Google links, Youtube) and find their own communities (Reddit, Facebook). However, applications such as TroveSkin and MayoClinic have created a place to do many of those activities. With this upcoming application, users should be able build an online community with similar concerns, receive recommendations to products that are advertised to their demographic, get general information about their health concerns, and keep a diary log of their skin conditions.

1. Contextual Inquiry Guide
2. User Interview Recording

## Interview Insight

## Reflection
There were a few internet connection issues during my interview, which resulted in me disconnecting from the Zoom meeting; however, I was still able to get through all of the tasks and questions. The interview itself though went well, I learned a lot about how users navigate throughout the web, which I feel would be less accessible for senior citizens. I also learned about what makes a skincare product more trustworthy in the eyes of the users, which differed slightly between skincare products and skin treatment products. As I develop my application, I will keep that in mind when establishing the hierarchy of information that will displayed for skin product reviews and descriptions. 

I think the most difficult part about Contextual Inquiries is finding key insights and connecting what the users say to the pain points that I have previously established from my heuristics evaluation. For future references, I hope for my Contextual Inquiries to be semi-structured (as opposed to structured) because the flow of my questions was very rigid given how my participants chose to respond. By having a less structured interview, I will potentially open doors to get deeper insight into the though process of the users.
