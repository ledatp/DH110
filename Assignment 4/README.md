## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to ensure that the designers always have the users in mind. By giving face, personality, and descriptions to specific users, designers will better understand their needs and accommodate them accordingly. In essence, putting ourselves in our user’s shoes, taking upon their perspective and bringing them along to better understand our audience base, the pain points of our project, and the appropriate action for betterment.

## Design Features and Changes
* Cater more towards skin condition and skin disorders, yet potentially maintaining the skincare aspects of TroveSkin
* Create a more extensive filter option for product recommendation and including better descriptions on product discovery page for ease of browsing
* Create a more minimal community feature with descriptive text to allow users to understand the features and possibilities, include subsections to groups, and allow for free text as well as postings

## Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Melissa Campra's Scenario
Melissa is a realtor from Brentwood, California who has been diagnosed with a very common skin disorder called psoriasis. She finds herself constantly going to a dermatologist to deal with flare ups in her skin and ask for further recommendations. She refuses to take medication after the first incident where one of the medications she took interfered with her other prescription medication. Therefore, she goes back and forth to the dermatologist for skin progress reports and recommendations. She realized that this process did not fit within her busy lifestyle as it took time away from her job and her outdoor time with her grandchildren. Thus, she wanted to take matters into her own hands and find products and keep a skin diary for herself.

Melissa goes to Google and searches up “products for psoriasis” and is met with many links. She opened the first few links in different tabs and proceeded to scroll through products. During this, she opens Amazon to search up the price and reviews of the products because she is very picky with the things she puts on her skin. Hence, if she cannot get a dermatologist review, the product must be well known and well liked. Once she finds a product that she likes, she heads over to YouTube and looks for videos of the product for more in depth reviews. This entire process was very overwhelming to her, so she decided not to continue and close out all tabs. Later, her friend introduced her to an application similar to TroveSkin, yet designed for people with skin disorders like her. Melissa has used TroveSkin before, but it did not have an extensive filter, more descriptive text for products, nor an easily located review page, so she is hoping this new application her friend reviewed will be much better.

The new application is exactly what she was looking for. After taking quizzes on her skin type, skin condition, and skin concerns, she was able to receive product recommendations immediately. She used some of the filters such as price, most popular, best ratings and did not have to scroll very far to find something that she liked. In addition, all the products had better descriptions in the browsing/discovery page, so she did not have to click and read through masses of text and reviews before making final decisions. Lastly, the application also offers a skin progress check/skin diary, which takes away some need for a dermatologist to review her skin as she now has an organized view of her psoriasis’ before and afters.

### John Sense's Scenario
John is a blogger from Hayward, California who has been diagnosed with a rare skin condition called Eosinophilic Folliculitis, a disease more common in infants. Because of the rarity of his skin condition, he has felt very isolated because of it - not being able to find people who share similar experience. Moreover, he describes himself to be very introverted, making it difficult to make friends as someone who is retired. 

John has used many social media applications to try to build relationships and gain friendships. He used Instagram and Facebook in the past, but quickly realized that the application is centered around its younger users as there are a lot of features he does not know how to use. In general the websites are overwhelming to him, especially as someone who does not use the internet often. The only thing he liked from Facebook was that you are able to join groups on there, allowing him to find a group with similar interest with him; however, much of his groups were to advertise events, difficult to scroll through everything to find information you are interested in, or had strict policies that seemed to limit connections such as: “Please, do not add or message another member of the group.” - a rule taken by one of the skin disorder support groups on Facebook. He seldomly returns to these social media, hoping to meet someone who found interests in his post, but no luck as these groups have never provided him comfort. In a last attempt to try social media, he found an application that was similar to TroveSkin.

Having used TroveSkin before, he also realized that the community feature was overwhelming and difficult to understand - especially with the lack of an onboarding system in place to teach him the ropes. Luckily, this new application is nothing like that. It is very minimalistic, allowing John to easily search and join a group for his specific skin condition easily and add posts. Each group allows the creation of subsections (e.g., separate sections for product recommendation, advice, events, personal advertisement etc.). In addition, this application allowed free chat, group responses allowing everyone to speak together without the surface level connections from simply responding to posts. With this feature, he was able to build friendships more quickly while also being able to head to other channels to get information on what he can do to help treat his skin condition as well as promote his blogs through the personal advertisement channel (without the excessive scrolling that was needed for other social media platforms). Thus, he is able to connect to people beyond just his skin condition if need be. He no longer feels isolated as he found a small group of people who struggle with Eosinophilic Folliculitis, while they build a more genuine relationship.
